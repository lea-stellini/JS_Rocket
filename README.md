# JS_Rocket

This project was created following Rich's "Launch a Rocket: Learn JavaScript Basics The Fun Way!" course on SkillShare.

## DESCRIPTION
Buzz Lightyear has a mission and only you can help him (and a random number generator). Your mission (if you accept it) is to launch Buzz Lightyear to infinity and from there click the "Launch" button. When you click the button a 10 sec countdown will start, so you will have only 10 sec to study the situation and see if the takeoff will succeed or fail. If you don't feel right, click the "Abort" button and try again. 
There is a 50/50 chance that Buzz Lightyear will succeed in his takeoff. So are you up for the challenge? 

## WHAT I LEARNED

I had done this project in 2020, but I decided to do it again in order to train myself on GitHub and git commands. During the realization of this project I used several times the commands : git status, git add, git commit -m, git push. Moreover, once I had created my repository I used git clone to duplicate the file on my local storage.
